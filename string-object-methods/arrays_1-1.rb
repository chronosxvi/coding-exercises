# 4. Create a new, empty file. Save it as arrays_1-1.rb. Fill in the following line:
    
#     numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
#     # your code goes here
# So that, when you run your code (run ruby arrays_1-1.rb), you get the following output:
#     5

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

puts numbers[4]
