# 13. There is a method on hashes that flips keys and values. Find that method on the Ruby documentation about hashes
# Make a new file hashes_1-5.rb, and fill in the following line using that method:
#     dictionary = { :one => 'uno', :two => 'dos', :three => 'tres' }
#     # your code goes here   
    
# This should then output:
    
#     { 'uno' => :one, 'dos' => :two, 'tres' => :three } 

dictionary = { :one => 'uno', :two => 'dos', :three => 'tres' }
